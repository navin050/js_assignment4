    <h3>11. Birthday Game</h3>
    <p>

        A[i]. <br>
        She decides to share a contiguous segment of the chocolate bar selected such that the length of the segment matches Yatharth's birth month 
        M
        and the sum of the integers on the squares is equal to his birthday 
        D
        .  <br>
